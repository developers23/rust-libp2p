# Floodsub

> A flooding PubSub system.

PubSub is a work in progress, with [`floodsub`](https://github.com/libp2p/go-floodsub/) as an initial protocol. Research on `gossipsub` (which is implemented in Go [here](https://github.com/libp2p/go-floodsub/pull/67)) is underway and work on it for Rust is planned to be started soon.

For the specification, see [here](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub).
